# DaAppLab-about
This project is used as a building block for my IoT projects. <br/>

Most of my IoT projects rely on a webserver hosted on a microcontroller.
The project may be new but the basic desing of the webserver is most of the time the same.
Therefore the commonly used files lie in this repository.

You can see the current status [here](https://captaindario.github.io/DaAppLab-about/index.html).
